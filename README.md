# Matlab-logBaseB
% result = loga(n,A,digit) take logarithm base n of each element in matrix A
% This function can take log base n of any real number, including negative ones, but base n must greater than 0
% Input:
%    n: the base of logarithm
%    A: input matrix/array/digit
%    digit: number of significant figures. Default = 3
% Output:
%    result: matrix A with each element is taken logarithm of base n
